# Computational Chemistry Simulation on Solana via Neon
See https://github.com/amva13/carbon-monoxide-evm-react for full description.

## Summary
Here I built a computational chemistry engine and deployed the program on the Solana blockchain. This program was written in Solidity. As such, the Neon EVM was used to run solidity on Solana. To visualize the simulation, a React App was developed and is available, along with the full description of the project on the linked repo above. This project was part of a hackathon submission and is largely built as a demo. Still, the tech stack is quite impressive.
